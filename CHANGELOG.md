# Changelog

All notable changes to FreeFlow are documented here.

This project uses semantic versioning for public releases. Use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

- `MAJOR` changes include breaking behavior or major compatibility changes.
- `MINOR` changes add user-visible features and improvements.
- `PATCH` changes fix bugs, polish existing behavior, or make small internal improvements.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- Removed the pause-based audio interruption mode that could misfire and resume playback unexpectedly; dictation now only mutes audio.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Faster live dictation with realtime transcription support.
- A setting for choosing the realtime transcription model.
- Run log exports, so you can save a full dictation run for debugging or sharing.
- A Copy Transcript action in the run log.
- A voice command for submitting text: say "press enter" at the end of a dictation.
- Audio controls that can mute or pause other audio while you dictate, then restore it when recording stops.
- Build details in Settings for easier troubleshooting.
- Direct shortcuts from FreeFlow to the right macOS permission settings.
- A What’s New popup when an update is available.

### Improved

- Recording feedback now feels more responsive.
- The run log is easier to scan and use.
- Exported run logs include more useful context for reproducing issues.
- Realtime transcription is more reliable when recordings are cancelled, retried, or finish with no text.
- Provider settings are easier to edit without accidental whitespace or half-saved values.
- FreeFlow now warns you if alert sounds may be hard to hear because system audio is muted or very low.
- Update prompts now show the version, release date, and release notes more clearly.
- FreeFlow now uses proper version numbers for updates instead of internal build names.

### Fixed

- Fixed cases where arrow or navigation keys could be mistaken for Fn shortcut input.
- Fixed a clipboard timing issue that could paste the wrong content.
- Fixed empty realtime transcriptions getting stuck instead of finishing cleanly.
- Fixed waveform glitches caused by invalid audio levels.
- Filtered out more common transcription artifacts.
- Fixed alert sound hints staying visible after alert sounds are turned off.
- Fixed update checks so users only see real app releases, not internal builds.
- Fixed update checks so the app does not offer an older or already-installed version.
